## Project Description
This project consists of an analysis of the average age of the world population and we have created a tool to predict age from an image.

## Hypotheses / Questions
* We believe that life expectancy is increasing for different reasons, for example, the evolution of modern medicine and the increasing evolution of society in general.

* We believe that the world's population is growing because of concerns about the continents with the highest poverty rates. We also believe that a continent with more land area will have more population.

## Dataset
* Dataset Age from https://ourworldindata.org/
* Dataset Images from UKTFace


## Cleaning
We have cleaned all the datasets used in this project with pandas, extracting null values, unnecessary columns and other things.

## Model Training and Evaluation
* We have trained the model with the UKTFace dataset. We used a neural network with 4 layers to extract the main features and 2 hidden layers with N neurons.

## Organization
We use Trello for organization
